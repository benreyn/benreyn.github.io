Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ben. Ive been a Software Engineer since 2015 and a hobbyist programmer since 2005. Professionally I have primarily done full stack web development in Ruby on Rails and I am passionate about working iteratively and shipping high quality, tested, maintainable code.

I am a big fan of the Hotwire front-end. I believe it provides the perfect mix of power and flexibility. I find that most modern products require developers to build full stack features quickly and ship in small iterative chunks, regularly reacting to user feedback. Rails, literally "Turbo"-charged with Turbolinks and Stimulus fit perfectly in this world.
